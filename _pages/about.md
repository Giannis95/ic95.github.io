I am a materials physicist with a distinction at MSc Nanomaterials (final grade 81%) and currently a PhD candidate in computational/ theory of magnetism in condensed matter physics. I have excelled in a wide range of specialised skills, from materials characterisation & synthesis to computational modelling, project management, communicating complex technological and scientific concepts and critical thinking. 

I seek to transition to the technology industry to provide my broad range of knowledge, social and technical skills and continue challenging myself.

My PhD research focuses on spintronics and nanomagnetic materials, with a focus on the effect of interface effects in thin films upon the dynamics and creation/destruction of exotic nanomagnetic spin textures. I have previously been involved in multiple projects, from understanding the effects of microstructures in meteorites formed in the early solar system to nuclear materials and designing functional materials for niche technological applications. 

I thrive in multidisciplinary and diverse environments while enjoying socialising with ambitious people eager to excel in their fields.
